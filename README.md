# scrappy koko

### Overview

In this project, I'll create a web app that lets users view and leave notes on the latest news. But I'm not going to actually write any articles; instead, i'll use my Mongoose and Cheerio knowledge to scrape news from another site.

### Tech used:

- express
- express-handlebars
- mongoose
- body-parser
- cheerio
- request

**NOTE**: _If you press scrape button and if there's no data or article showing, chances are nytimes change their class names or HTML structure_
